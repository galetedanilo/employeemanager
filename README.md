# EmployeeManager

Hello everyone, my name is Danilo Galete and I'm a system analysis and development student and in this example we'll learn how to implement 
a RESTful API using Spring Boot Framework.
We have Spring Boot on the backend and AngularJS on the frontend working together to create a simple employee management application.
In this example we'll work correctly using http verbs, POST, GET, PUT and DELETE. Let's work with the lombok and mapstruct libraries, 
very popular designs for you to use in your future projects.
